-- Simple fix for chat RLS policies - Avoid infinite recursion
-- Run this in your Supabase dashboard SQL editor

-- Drop ALL existing policies to avoid conflicts
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their conversations" ON conversations;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can create conversations" ON conversations;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can insert conversations" ON conversations;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view conversations" ON conversations;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their conversation participants" ON conversation_participants;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can insert conversation participants" ON conversation_participants;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view participants" ON conversation_participants;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can join conversations" ON conversation_participants;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view messages in their conversations" ON messages;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view messages" ON messages;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can send messages" ON messages;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update messages" ON messages;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update seen status" ON messages;

-- Create very simple, permissive policies to avoid recursion
-- These policies are basic but will work for now

-- Conversations: Allow all operations for authenticated users
CREATE POLICY "conversations_all"
ON conversations FOR ALL
USING (auth.uid() IS NOT NULL)
WITH CHECK (auth.uid() IS NOT NULL);

-- Conversation participants: Allow all operations for authenticated users
CREATE POLICY "conversation_participants_all"
ON conversation_participants FOR ALL
USING (auth.uid() IS NOT NULL)
WITH CHECK (auth.uid() IS NOT NULL);

-- Messages: Allow all operations for authenticated users
CREATE POLICY "messages_all"
ON messages FOR ALL
USING (auth.uid() IS NOT NULL)
WITH CHECK (auth.uid() IS NOT NULL);
