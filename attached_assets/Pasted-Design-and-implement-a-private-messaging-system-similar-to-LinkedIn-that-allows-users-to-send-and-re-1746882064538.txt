Design and implement a private messaging system similar to LinkedIn that allows users to send and receive messages with their existing connections. The system should support chat threads, notifications, real-time updates, message status (seen/unseen), and a clean inbox interface.

🧩 Core Features & Flow

1. Start New Conversation
	•	Users can only message users they are connected with.
	•	From another user’s profile or “My Connections” page, show a “Message” button.
	•	Clicking it opens a chat window or inbox thread, creating a new conversation if it doesn’t already exist.

2. Inbox / Message Center
	•	Central place to view all conversations.
	•	Each conversation entry should show:
	•	User name & photo
	•	Latest message preview
	•	Timestamp of last message
	•	Message read status (unread bolded, read normal)
	•	Conversations should be sorted by most recent activity.

3. Real-Time Chat View
	•	Inside the conversation view:
	•	Show the full message thread between both users.
	•	Support text, emoji, and optionally images or attachments.
	•	Each message should show sender, time sent, and read receipt (e.g., single tick = sent, double tick = read).
	•	If the recipient is online, show “Active now” or “Typing…”.

4. Send Messages
	•	Input field at the bottom with:
	•	Send button
	•	Optionally: Emoji picker, file upload, voice note (future enhancement)
	•	On pressing send:
	•	The message should appear instantly in the conversation thread.
	•	Deliver to the receiver in real-time if online.

5. Message Read Status
	•	When a recipient opens a message:
	•	Update message status from “sent” to “seen”.
	•	Optionally show “Seen” below last message.
	•	Display small indicators for message status (✔️ = sent, 👁️ = read).

6. Notifications
	•	When a new message is received:
	•	Show a real-time notification (toast/pop-up or bell icon badge).
	•	Update unread count in the message icon on the navbar.
	•	Allow push/browser notifications for real-time alerting (optional).

7. Unread Messages and Badges
	•	Clearly distinguish unread messages in inbox.
	•	Show unread message count on message icon in navbar.
	•	If the user opens the chat, mark messages as read.

8. Delete or Archive Conversations (Optional)
	•	Allow users to archive or delete conversations from their inbox.
	•	Archived chats can be moved to a separate tab or restored later.

9. Block or Report User (Optional Enhancement)
	•	Add a small menu in chat to block/report users for spam or harassment.
	•	Once blocked, messaging should be disabled in both directions.
