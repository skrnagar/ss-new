Create a full-featured blogging platform similar to Medium using Next.js 14 (App Router) and Supabase. The application should allow users to write, edit, publish, and read articles with a rich text editor. The key features should include:

User Authentication:
• Implement authentication using Supabase (Email, Google, LinkedIn).
• Only logged-in users should be able to write or comment on articles.

Rich Text Editor:
• Use TipTap or Quill.js for a Medium-like writing experience.
• Support text formatting (bold, italic, headings, links, images, etc.).
• Autosave drafts and allow users to publish later.
Article Management:
• Users can create, edit, and delete their own articles.
• Articles should include title, content, cover image, tags, and publish date.
• Store drafts before publishing.
Article Display & Reading Experience:
• Design a clean, minimalist UI for reading articles.
• Include author info, publish date, read time, and tags.
• Optimize typography for readability (similar to Medium).
Commenting System:
• Allow users to comment and reply on articles.
• Display the number of comments below each article.
Likes & Reactions:
• Users can like or bookmark articles.
• Show total likes on each article page.
User Profiles & Dashboard:
• Each user should have a profile page showing their published articles.
• Profile should display username, bio, and avatar.
Search & Tags:
• Users should be able to search articles by title, author, or tags.
• Implement a trending tags section for easy discovery.
SEO & Social Sharing:
• Optimize article pages for SEO (meta title, description, OpenGraph tags).
• Add social sharing buttons (Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook).
Tech Stack:
• Frontend: Next.js 14 (App Router) with Tailwind CSS.
• Backend: Supabase (PostgreSQL) for data storage and authentication.
• Storage: Supabase Storage for images.
• Editor: TipTap or Quill.js for rich-text functionality.

Ensure the application is fully responsive and provides a smooth UX across devices. The UI should resemble Medium’s clean and distraction-free design.”
