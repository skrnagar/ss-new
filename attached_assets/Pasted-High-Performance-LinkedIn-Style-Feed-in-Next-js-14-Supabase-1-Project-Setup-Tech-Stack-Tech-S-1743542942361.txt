High-Performance LinkedIn-Style Feed in Next.js 14 & Supabase

1. Project Setup & Tech Stack

Tech Stack:

Frontend: Next.js 14, TypeScript, React Query, Zustand (for state management)

Backend: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Realtime, Edge Functions, Storage)

Performance Optimization: Supabase Indexing, ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration), Optimistic UI Updates

2. Database Optimization & Schema Design

Tables Required:

posts: Stores post content, user_id, media, likes_count, comments_count

likes: Tracks user_id, post_id (unique constraint for preventing duplicate likes)

comments: Stores comments linked to posts and users

users: Stores user profiles

Optimized Queries:

âœ… Indexes for Faster Queries: Index created_at for efficient sorting
âœ… Cursor-based Pagination: Fetch new posts efficiently with infinite scroll
âœ… Edge Functions: Heavy queries (personalized feeds, trending posts)
âœ… Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Control post visibility based on user permissions

3. Real-Time Feed Implementation

Optimized Data Fetching:

âœ… Supabase Realtime: Live updates for new posts, likes, and comments
âœ… React Query: Cache responses, mutations for efficient state updates
âœ… Incremental Loading: Infinite scroll using cursor-based pagination

4. Optimistic UI Updates for Better UX

âœ… Instant UI Updates: Before DB confirmation, update UI for likes, comments
âœ… Preloading Recent Posts: Prefetch latest posts for a seamless experience
âœ… Efficient Reactivity: Zustand for state management, prevent unnecessary re-renders

5. Media Handling & Storage

âœ… Compress Images Before Upload: Reduce load times
âœ… Supabase Storage: Store and retrieve media with public URLs
âœ… Lazy Loading: Load images/videos only when needed

6. Ranking Algorithm & Personalization

Recency-based Sorting: Latest posts first

Engagement Score: Rank posts based on likes, comments, shares

AI-based Personalization: Show relevant posts based on user interactions

7. Real-Time Notifications & Messaging

âœ… Notifications: Supabase Edge Functions or AWS EventBridge for push notifications
âœ… Live Chat: Supabase Realtime (Postgres LISTEN/NOTIFY) or AWS AppSync (GraphQL WebSockets)

8. Advanced Features for Future Enhancements

âœ… Hashtags & Mentions: Auto-suggestions for better engagement
âœ… AI-based Content Moderation: AWS Comprehend or OpenAI API for filtering inappropriate content
âœ… Multi-user Collaboration Features: Similar to LinkedInâ€™s "Work with a team"

9. Performance & Security Best Practices

âœ… Server-Side Rendering (SSR) for SEO
âœ… React Query Prefetching & ISR for Caching
âœ… Row-Level Security (RLS) for Data Protection

ðŸš€ Implementation Plan for Your Next.js App

Set Up Database: Create tables, apply indexing, and enable RLS

Implement Feed UI: Design post creation, infinite scrolling, and real-time updates

Optimize Data Fetching: Use React Query, Supabase Realtime, and Edge Functions

Enhance Performance: Implement optimistic UI updates, caching, and lazy loading

Deploy & Scale: Optimize for Supabase Edge, Vercel, and CDN for media storage
