Create a full-featured blogging platform similar to Medium using Next.js 14 (App Router) and Supabase. The application should allow users to write, edit, publish, and read articles with a rich text editor. The key features should include:
	1.	User Authentication:
	•	Implement authentication using Supabase (Email, Google, LinkedIn).
	•	Only logged-in users should be able to write or comment on articles.
	2.	Rich Text Editor:
	•	Use TipTap or Quill.js for a Medium-like writing experience.
	•	Support text formatting (bold, italic, headings, links, images, etc.).
	•	Autosave drafts and allow users to publish later.
	3.	Article Management:
	•	Users can create, edit, and delete their own articles.
	•	Articles should include title, content, cover image, tags, and publish date.
	•	Store drafts before publishing.
	4.	Article Display & Reading Experience:
	•	Design a clean, minimalist UI for reading articles.
	•	Include author info, publish date, read time, and tags.
	•	Optimize typography for readability (similar to Medium).
	5.	Commenting System:
	•	Allow users to comment and reply on articles.
	•	Display the number of comments below each article.
	6.	Likes & Reactions:
	•	Users can like or bookmark articles.
	•	Show total likes on each article page.
	7.	User Profiles & Dashboard:
	•	Each user should have a profile page showing their published articles.
	•	Profile should display username, bio, and avatar.
	8.	Search & Tags:
	•	Users should be able to search articles by title, author, or tags.
	•	Implement a trending tags section for easy discovery.
	9.	SEO & Social Sharing:
	•	Optimize article pages for SEO (meta title, description, OpenGraph tags).
	•	Add social sharing buttons (Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook).
	10.	Tech Stack:

	•	Frontend: Next.js 14 (App Router) with Tailwind CSS.
	•	Backend: Supabase (PostgreSQL) for data storage and authentication.
	•	Storage: Supabase Storage for images.
