Image Optimizations
Next.js provides automatic image optimizations with instant builds. Image optimization is a powerful feature prebuilt into Next.js because managing and optimizing images requires many configurations, and manually optimizing images can take a toll on your productive time.

Internationalization
Creating an enterprise application can be easily translated into different languages worldwide. Internationalization takes less configuration to get set up, making Next.js internationally recognized.

Next.js Analytics
Next.js provides an analytical dashboard that can be configured to show accurate visitor data and page insights out of the box. Quickly build an analytical dashboard and gain valuable insights into your visitors and page insights without extra coding or configuration.

Zero Config
Next.js compiles and builds automatically with hot refresh without any extra configuration. It automatically scales and optimizes your production application with hot refresh right out of the box.

Prebuilt SSR, SSG, and CSR Support
With Next.js, you support server-side rendering, static generation, and client-side rendering in one application. Decide the type of application you want to build and how you intend to compile your application to best suit your use case.

Code-Splitting and Bundling
NextJS has the potential to render pages with the needed libraries as per the project requirements. It concentrates on creating multiple resources rather than a large solo JavaScript file. Whenever a page loads, you can view the required JavaScript page.

Incremental Static Regeneration(ISR)
Develop or modify your static pages with this framework. It enables your NextJS developers to use static generation page-by-page with Incremental Static Regeneration and avoid the complexities of rebuilding the site. Achieve high scalability while retaining the advantages of being static.

TypeScript Support
The NextJS framework offers automatic TypeScript configuration and compilation for APIs, Pages, and more. This built-in support feature gives an integrated TypeScript experience to start a new project from scratch or change an existing one.
